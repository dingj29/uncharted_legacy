# Uncharted Legacy
Uncharted Legacy is a fantasy card game for 2 players.
The game took me nearly 2 years to complete. I built everything from scratch by designing game rules and using Photoshop to draw the digital paintings. 
I am super excited to show it to you. Hope you all like it!

## Game Background
In fable place of crisis – ridden with death, that swallows all lives who dare to step in, an ancient folklore exists. It says that there are five types of fragments 
of five arcane hidden gems, which store the unlimited fierce power. The Explorer, Pirate and Wizard, who come from different parts of the world and claimed to find 
the uncharted legacy. They see each other as enemies and the only way to defeat the other is to hold three gems out of five.

## Game System & Objectives
At the beginning of the game, each player randomly chooses one Character from card pile. (Pirate and Explorer have their own initial weapons but the wizard does have 
his own monsters to start with) Place 12 back-oriented cards on the table in two rows; the number in each row is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively. As the cards are 
flipped, the aligned cards create a conflict. The person who wins one conflict would obtain fragments from the pile of fragments. The goal is to win 3 gems out of five.
- 	The same cards have the power to nullify one another.
- 	The winner of each fight would use the difference of strengths divided by 5 and take that number of fragments from pile of fragments.   
- 	When only six cards left on the table, new back-oriented cards would fill the gaps.
- 	The player who has 3 gems out of 5 would win the game and capture the relic. If not, a draw would be the result.
- 	After all the cards are distributed, an evitable battle would activate.
- 	Pirate and Explore have to defeat the monster once they have encountered, followed by battle with rivalry (may or may not). Wizard has to give up 5 points 
      in order to domesticate monsters, or give up the card – no need to fight.
- 	Explorer: she has two potions with her before entering battle each with 10 points of defense.
- 	Pirate: he has ability to plunder one weapon from his opponent (weapon only)
- 	Wizard: he has to give up 5 points each time he find a monster (not include initiative weapons) in order to domesticate monsters.
- 	When two players are fighting, always calculate sum of points of attack and points of defense. Spells is instantaneous attack.
